# GEMM Performance evaluation 
This repo provide source code to run GEMM on both CUDA kernel and OPENCL kernel. 
The profiling code collects  kernel execution time. The idea is to compare software stack difference between Nvidia native CUDA and OpenCL SW stack.

# HW 
We collected result on Nivida GPU GeForce RTX 4080 for both CUDA and OpenCL to rule out the difference brought by HW
The focus is on SW stack

# Task
MxN 
M (8192, 8192)
N (8192, 8192)

# Result
Kernel time(CUDA): ~435ms
Kernel time(OpenCL): ~12524ms

# Reason
1. Vendor Optimization
CUDA: NVIDIA develops and optimizes CUDA specifically for its GPUs. The CUDA runtime and compiler (nvcc) are deeply integrated with NVIDIA hardware, offering highly tuned math libraries like cuBLAS and better GPU utilization.
OpenCL: Although NVIDIA supports OpenCL, it is treated as a secondary priority. OpenCL compilers and runtimes for NVIDIA GPUs may not be as optimized as CUDA.
2. Compiler Optimization
CUDA Kernel: The nvcc compiler can apply aggressive optimizations because it is tailored specifically for NVIDIA hardware. It can leverage architectural features like warp-level primitives, register utilization, and memory access optimizations.
OpenCL Kernel: OpenCL relies on a more generic compiler model, which may not generate code that fully exploits NVIDIA GPU-specific optimizations.
3. Driver and Runtime Overhead
CUDA: The CUDA runtime and driver are tightly coupled, ensuring minimal overhead during kernel execution and memory transfers. NVIDIA’s driver is optimized specifically for CUDA workloads.
OpenCL: OpenCL introduces additional layers of abstraction to ensure cross-platform compatibility, which can result in more overhead compared to CUDA.
4. Math Libraries
If you’re using NVIDIA’s cuBLAS in CUDA (or implicitly relying on its optimizations), it can significantly outperform a custom-written GEMM kernel in OpenCL. cuBLAS is highly optimized for GEMM operations, including tiling, loop unrolling, and data reuse strategies.
In OpenCL, unless you explicitly use an optimized library (like clBLAS or clBlast), the kernel might lack these advanced optimizations.
5. Memory Access Patterns
CUDA kernels often have better handling of coalesced memory accesses (sequential access to global memory) because the CUDA runtime optimizes for the warp-based execution model.
OpenCL kernels, depending on how they are written and compiled, may suffer from less efficient memory access patterns.
6. Thread Scheduling and Warp Efficiency
CUDA is optimized for warps (32 threads in a warp) and uses hardware features like warp divergence management to maximize performance.
OpenCL adopts a more generic execution model, and the thread scheduler may not handle NVIDIA GPUs’ warp-based architecture as efficiently.
7. Kernel Launch Overhead
CUDA kernel launches are designed to minimize overhead on NVIDIA GPUs.
OpenCL kernel launches may introduce more latency because the platform must perform additional checks and handle a more generalized device execution model.
8. Hardware-Specific Optimizations
CUDA allows developers to explicitly leverage NVIDIA-specific features like:
Shared memory and warp shuffles
Tensor cores (on supported GPUs) for GEMM
OpenCL does not expose NVIDIA-specific hardware features directly unless you use proprietary NVIDIA extensions, which are less common in OpenCL.
9. Workgroup and Tuning Differences
CUDA:
The block and thread dimensions can be directly optimized for NVIDIA’s architecture.
For example, CUDA uses blockDim and threadIdx to define the optimal grid and thread-block sizes.
OpenCL:
OpenCL uses workgroups and global/local sizes, which may require more manual tuning. A poorly chosen workgroup size can negatively impact performance.
10. Code Generation and Profiling
When compiling OpenCL code, the kernel is usually compiled at runtime, which might result in suboptimal code generation unless the program is precompiled using a vendor-specific toolchain.
CUDA compiles code offline, allowing more aggressive optimizations and detailed tuning.
